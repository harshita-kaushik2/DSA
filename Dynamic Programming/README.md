# Dynamic Programming
Remember these 3 general steps that have to be applied while creating a solution using DP : 

1. Represent the problem in terms of index
2. Do all possible stuffs on that index according to the problem statement.
3. Sum of all stuffs (to count all ways) or min/max as per question.
